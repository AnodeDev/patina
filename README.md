# PATINA

## About

This is my own configuration language that is mainly geared towards configuring my other projects, [oxide][(ttps://github.com/AnodeDev/oxide) and [catalyst](https://github.com/AnodeDev/catalyst).

## Why?

Because...

Yeah, there's no other reason. My goal is to have my own ecosystem of utilities, and making a configuration language is a really important utility.

The language uses [S-expressions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S-expression) (symbolic expressions) which are easy to parse and easy to write. It's a really simple language. It will also support custom API's tied to a specific program, similar to how [Neovim](https://github.com/neovim/neovim) is configured using [Lua](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lua_(programming_language)). This will make it really easy to use the language for configuration, since it doesn't need to have built-in support for the specific application.

The language is "meant" to be used with [redox](https://github.com/AnodeDev/redox) when it's ready, to complete the Emacs Org-Mode experience.

## Roadmap

- [ ] Complete the syntax
- [ ] Write an efficient lexer
- [ ] Something inbetween...
- [ ] Done :)
